# latex.slides.g8

__TODO:__ This README was written in a rush, and I need to come back
and clean it up.     

Unofficial, opinionated
[Giter8](https://www.foundweekends.org/giter8/template.html) template
for LaTeX Beamer slides, using the
[Metropolis](https://github.com/matze/mtheme) theme for Beamer.

The project generated by this template is based on Martin Kleppmann's
[Cambridge distributed systems
notes](https://github.com/ept/dist-sys).  Once you've generated a
project skeleton using the `g8` template you're currently reading
about, you can consult his documentation for pointers on how to edit
and build your own course materials, substituting for `dist-sys`
whatever name you've given `g8` to generate your own project.

Building the PDF files requires a [LaTeX
distribution](https://www.latex-project.org/get/) and
[Pygments](https://pygments.org/) for syntax highlighting source
code. You must run `pdflatex` with `-shell-escape` so that `pdflatex`
can run `pygmentize`.  The skeletal project includes some examples
taken from the Kleppman notes that demonstrate things like drawing
figures with [TikZ](https://pgf-tikz.github.io/pgf/pgfmanual.pdf).

## What the Template Provides and How to Use It

If you've told `g8` to name your project `foo`, then:
- The `Makefile` builds everything.  Just type `make`.
- `foo.tex` contains all the actual content.
- `foo-slides.tex` is the entry point for the slides, formatted for
  live, on-screen presentation
- `foo-handout.tex` is the entry point for the slides in
  printer-friendly format.
- `foo-notes.tex` is the entry point for the lecture notes, and
  contains expository prose you write, typeset around the embedded
  slides.
- __TODO:__ Add exposition here on `solutions.tex` as the entry point
  for the solution notes for the exercises, and how that content is
  written to `exercises.tex` when you build `foo-notes.pdf`     

## How to Create a New Slides Project Using Giter8

If `g8` is installed on your machine (see the next section for more on
`g8` installation), you can create a new slides project by running:
```bash
g8 jerrykuch/latex.slides.g8
```
and filling out the requested fields to generate your project
skeleton.   What you enter for `name` will be used as the folder name (a
new folder will be created if not present), `title` will be used for the slide
deck's title (you can edit the title later), and so on.

You can also  generate a new project from a local clone of the repo
you're currently looking at by using `g8` as follows:
```
g8 file:///<local-checkout-dir>/latex.slides.g8/ --name=<name> --title=<title> --author=<project author> --force
```
The above also demonstrates using command line parameters to
pre-answer some of the questions `g8` would otherwise ask you.

For more details on using `g8`, look [here](http://www.foundweekends.org/giter8/usage.html#Usage).

## How to Create a New Slides Project Using `sbt`

If you don't have 'g8' installed, by you do have `sbt` on your
machine, you can do the following:
```bash
sbt new jerrykuch/latex.slides.g8 --name=<name> --title=<title> --author=<project author> --force
```
Or, from a local clone of the repo (be careful to pull the latest
changes locally before running the command):
```bash
sbt new file:///<local-checkout-dir>/latex.slides.g8 --name=<name> --title=<title> --author=<project author> --force
```

For more options, refer to the original documentation in
https://www.scala-sbt.org/ and
http://www.foundweekends.org/giter8/setup.html respectively.

## Installing Giter8

On MAC OS X, both `sbt` and `giter8` are available via the Homebrew
package manager:
```
brew update
brew install giter8
brew install sbt
```

## License

Like the original lecture notes that this `g8` template skeletonizes,
the template is published under a [Creative Commons BY-SA
license](). Informally speaking, this means you can use it freely as
long as you give Martin Kleppmann credit for the original LaTeX
project structure and build system, and when you base your own work on
it, you distribute your derivative work under the same license as the
original.
